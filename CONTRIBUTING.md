# Contributing

This is a Jekyll site and is hosted on GitHub Pages, so some restrictions apply to what 
can be done featurewise. Sending us links to tools should not be too much trouble though.

1. Edit `_data/tools.yml` and copy/paste/tweak another tool.
2. Try and avoid using the word "Swagger" unless you work for SmartBear and are literally talking about the Swagger toolsuite. It's been called OpenAPI for years now.
3. We only want modern tooling, so if its OpenAPI v2.0 only (and is not in the progress of adding v3 support) maybe find a different tool.
4. We try talk about "Description Documents" instead of "Specs" for [reasons][overloaded-terms].
5. Send a pull request and make sure the build doesn't break!
